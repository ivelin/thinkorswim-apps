# Shows the number of new 52-week highs - new 52-week lows by day for the selected exchange. If the
# number of lows is greater than the number of highs, the value will be negative. If highs are
# greater, the number will be positive. Exchange = "ETF" shows net highs - lows for all ETFs listed
# on the 4 exchanges.
#
# The TOS symbols don't appear to work at expected when the aggregation period is WEEK so this
# study is only for daily charts.
