## Net New Highs - Lows

Leading market trend indicator that shows whether stocks in a given period have net new 52 week highs or net new lows. Generally if periods of net new highs are more frequent than periods with net new lows, it may indicate that a bullish market trend is forming. Respectively if periods of net new lows are more frequent, that may indicate that a bear market trend is forming.

Celebrity investor Matt Caruso explains in the video below when this indicator can be helpful:
